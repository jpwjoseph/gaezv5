# gaezv5 0.1.2 (Development)

## New Features

### Country-Level Cropping ‚≠ê
* **`get_country_boundary()`** - New helper function for retrieving country boundaries
  - Accepts country names, ISO3 codes, or custom SpatVector objects
  - Downloads GADM boundaries with automatic caching
  - Supports multiple administrative levels (0=country, 1=provinces, etc.)
  - Smart country matching with fuzzy search and error suggestions

* **`load_gaez_data()` now supports country cropping**
  - New `country` parameter for automatic cropping to country-level data
  - New `mask_to_boundary` parameter (TRUE=mask, FALSE=crop to extent only)
  - New `keep_global` parameter to control global file retention
  - Cropped files automatically named with "_[ISO3]" suffix
  - Significantly reduces file sizes for regional analysis
  - Examples:
    - `load_gaez_data(crop = "maize", country = "Niger")`
    - `load_gaez_data(crop = "wheat", country = "NER", keep_global = FALSE)`

* **`combine_gaez_batch()` now supports country cropping**
  - Same country cropping parameters as `load_gaez_data()`
  - Crops all layers in batch to specified country
  - Automatic NetCDF filename updates with ISO3 codes
  - Option to delete global files after cropping
  - Perfect for country-specific time series and scenario analysis

### Data Loading and Combination

* **`load_gaez_data()`** - Streamlined one-function workflow for downloading and loading GAEZ data
  - Automatically checks cache and downloads if needed
  - Returns terra SpatRaster object ready for analysis
  - Optional metadata return with `return_metadata = TRUE`
  - Simplifies workflow: `maize <- load_gaez_data(crop = "maize", time_period = "HP0120")`

* **`combine_gaez_batch()`** - Combine batch downloads into multi-layer datasets
  - Takes `batch_download_gaez_datasets()` output and creates single SpatRaster
  - Automatic layer naming from batch result parameters
  - Optional NetCDF export with compression
  - Ideal for time series analysis and scenario comparisons
  - Example: Download multiple time periods and combine into single file

## Changes

* **Added geodata to Imports**
  - Required for GADM boundary downloads in country cropping features
  - Version: geodata (>= 0.5.0)

* **Moved terra from Suggests to Imports**
  - terra is now a core dependency for new loading/combination functions
  - Existing functions still use `requireNamespace()` for backward compatibility

## Performance Improvements

* **Reduced file sizes**: Country-level data is 10-100x smaller than global datasets
* **Faster loading**: Smaller cropped files load much faster into R
* **Storage efficiency**: Optional deletion of global files saves disk space
* **Smart caching**: Cropped files are cached and reused on subsequent calls

## Major Enhancements

### Parallel Downloads
* **Parallel download support** in `batch_download_gaez_datasets()` using `curl::multi_download()`
  - 3-6x faster for multiple files (depending on network and HTTP/2 support)
  - Built-in progress bar showing download status
  - Automatic HTTP/2 multiplexing when server supports it
  - Resume capability for interrupted downloads
  - Set `parallel = FALSE` to use sequential mode for debugging

### Time Series Support
* **Multiple time period downloads** in single batch operation
  - Download historical and future periods together: `c("HP0120", "FP4160", "FP6180")`
  - Automatic SSP/climate model pairing based on time period
  - Smart validation filters invalid combinations (e.g., historical + future SSP)
  - Ideal for climate change impact studies and time series analysis

### Enhanced Parameter Handling
* **Flexible parameter types** - now accepts both vectors and lists
  - `crops = c("MZE", "WHE")` and `crops = list("MZE", "WHE")` both work
  - Automatic type conversion for all vector parameters
  - Fully backward compatible with existing code

### Improved Documentation
* Updated `batch_download_gaez_datasets()` documentation
  - Added "Parameter Flexibility" section
  - Added "Parallel Downloads" section with performance notes
  - Added "Time Period and SSP/Climate Model Validation" details
  - New examples showing time series downloads and parallel options

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed sequential mode parameter passing in `batch_download_gaez_datasets()`
  - Resolved "unused arguments" error when calling `download_gaez_dataset()`
  - Proper dots filtering to prevent parameter conflicts
* Fixed `expand.grid()` type errors with list parameters
  - Added automatic conversion of lists to atomic vectors
  - Function now handles mixed list/vector parameter input gracefully
* Enhanced validation logic for time period/SSP/climate model combinations

## Performance Improvements

* Parallel downloads using curl's native multi-download capability
* Reduced redundant file existence checks
* Optimized URL building for batch operations
* Total download time reporting for batch operations

## Dependencies

* Added `curl (>= 5.0.0)` to Imports for parallel download support

# gaezv5 0.1.0

## Initial Release

The `gaezv5` package provides comprehensive tools for downloading and working with Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) version 5 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).
